# How to Find Your Correct Clerk Publishable Key

Based on the information you provided, your Clerk instance appears to be at:
**golden-grackle-88.clerk.accounts.dev**

## Important Security Note
You provided a secret key (`sk_test_...`) - this should NEVER be used in frontend applications or committed to code. Only use the publishable key (`pk_test_...`) in your frontend.

## Steps to Get Your Publishable Key:

### Option 1: Via Clerk Dashboard
1. Go to: https://dashboard.clerk.com/ 
2. Sign in to your account
3. Select your "golden-grackle-88" application
4. Click on "API Keys" in the left sidebar
5. Copy the **Publishable key** (NOT the secret key)
   - It should look like: `pk_test_[long-string-of-characters]`
   - It will be 50-100 characters long

### Option 2: Direct Instance URL
1. Try going to: https://golden-grackle-88.clerk.accounts.dev
2. Sign in with your credentials
3. Look for "API Keys" or "Developer" section
4. Copy the publishable key

## What the Keys Should Look Like:

### Correct Format:
```
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_b1FtYXppbmctcmFiYml0LTI3LmNsZXJrLmFjY291bnRzLmRldiQ
```

### Incorrect (What you currently have):
```
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_Z29sZGVuLWdyYWNrbGUtODguY2xlcmsuYWNjb3VudHMuZGV2JA
```

## Once You Have the Correct Key:

1. Update your `.env` file:
```env
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_[your-actual-key-here]
```

2. Restart your development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. The OAuth options should now appear on the sign-in page

## Need Help?

If you can't find your publishable key:
1. Log into https://dashboard.clerk.com/
2. Check which application you're using
3. Make sure you're copying the "Publishable key" not the "Secret key"
4. The key should be much longer than what you currently have

## Security Reminder
- **Publishable Key** (`pk_test_...`): Safe to use in frontend, can be exposed
- **Secret Key** (`sk_test_...`): Backend only, must be kept secret, never commit to code
