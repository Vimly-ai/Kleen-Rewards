# Clerk MFA/Factor-One Route Fix

## Issue
After signing in, Clerk was redirecting to `/auth/factor-one` for multi-factor authentication, which resulted in a 404 error because the route wasn't defined in the application.

## Solution
The fix involved three changes:

1. **Updated Route Definition** (`/src/router/AppRouter.tsx`):
   - Changed `/auth` route to `/auth/*` to handle all Clerk authentication sub-routes
   - This allows Clerk to use routes like `/auth/factor-one`, `/auth/factor-two`, etc.

2. **Updated Clerk Configuration** (`/src/components/SimpleClerkAuth.tsx`):
   - Added `signInUrl` and `signUpUrl` properties to ensure consistent routing
   - Used `routing: 'path' as const` for proper TypeScript typing

3. **Improved Navigation Handler** (`/src/components/ClerkProviderWithFallback.tsx`):
   - Modified the `navigate` function to handle internal routes using React Router
   - This ensures smooth navigation between Clerk's authentication flows

## How It Works
- When Clerk needs to show MFA verification, it redirects to `/auth/factor-one`
- The wildcard route `/auth/*` catches this and renders the AuthPage component
- Clerk's SignIn/SignUp components handle the MFA flow internally
- After successful authentication (including MFA), users are redirected to the appropriate dashboard

## Testing
To test the fix:
1. Enable MFA/2FA in your Clerk dashboard for a user account
2. Sign in with that account
3. You should see the MFA verification screen without any 404 errors
4. After entering the MFA code, you should be redirected to the appropriate dashboard

## Additional Notes
- This fix supports all Clerk authentication flows including:
  - Email/password sign in
  - OAuth providers (Google, GitHub, etc.)
  - Multi-factor authentication
  - Password reset flows
  - Email verification flows
